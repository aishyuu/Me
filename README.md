# Me Social Media App

## Description
This is a social media app where users can post their photos, like them, and comment. They can also save images and they will be stored within the users profile for later use. The app lets you sign in using Google Authentication. The app takes heavy inspiration from pintrest.

## The outcome
The outcome of this project is to get a grasp on how social media apps are handled and how to use a CMS (Content Management System) to manage the creation and modification of digital content. Other than that it was a fun way to put everything together and see how a React App can be fully utilized in a social media setting.
